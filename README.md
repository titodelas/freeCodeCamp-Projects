# FREE CODE CAMP PROJECTS
In this repository, my projects and lines of code for freeCodeCamp certificates are stored.
Remember that it is totally forbidden to steal / copy internet codes for your own certificate, so don't do it.
Here you have the freeCodeCamp [Honesty Code of Conduct](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/).
