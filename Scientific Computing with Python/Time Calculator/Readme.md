This implementation first parses the start time and duration time into hours and minutes, then adds the duration to the start time to get the end time. The end time is formatted as a string, with the hour in 12-hour clock format and the meridian (AM or PM) determined based on whether the hour is before or after noon. If a day of the week is given, the function calculates the day offset based on the number of days that have passed since the starting day, and adds the appropriate text to the end of the output string. If no day of the week is given, the function only adds text for the number of days that have passed.
